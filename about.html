    <h3>Engine and transmission</h3>

The Roma is powered by the Ferrari type F154 engine. It is a 3.9 litres (3,855 cc), turbocharged, 90 degree V-8, dual overhead cam (DOHC) design. The Roma's type 154BH is rated at 456 kW; 612 hp (620 PS) between 5,750 and 7,500 rpm and 761 N⋅m (561 lb⋅ft) of torque between 3,000 and 5,750 rpm.


<h3><b>Ferrari Roma Type 154 Engine</b></h3>
The forced induction air intake system uses twin parallel water cooled turbochargers and two air-to-air intercoolers. The dry sump lubrication system helps prevent oil starvation during high g-force operation.[12]

The engine is mated to the new 8-speed dual-clutch F1 transmission shared with the SF90 Stradale. This new unit translates into more acceleration in the intermediate gears with an extended tall top gear for motorway cruising. Ferrari says there is 15 percent more longitudinal pull in third gear when compared to the previous generation's 7-speed unit.[13] The transaxle is equipped with an electronic differential and a mechanical reverse gear which contrasts to the SF90's electric motor reverse. This design weighs 6 kg (13 lb) less than the 7-speed unit used in the Portofino and is claimed to provide quicker and smoother shifting. Much of the weight savings is due to the dry sump design and the primary alloy oil case that is compact and wrapped tightly around the various engine components.
